A keylogger is a program that logs the keystrokes that a user makes on a computer. They can be used for both legitimate and malicious purposes.
Keyloggers are designed to intercept the keystrokes being sent to a computer. Hardware keyloggers can accomplish this by physically connecting to a computer keyboard to intercept keystrokes, while software keyloggers listen to the events triggered within a computer when a key is pressed. In addition to recording keystrokes, keyloggers may be designed to collect sensitive information in other ways. For example, keystroke monitoring may be used to capture video from a webcam or use the microphone to record audio on an infected device.
